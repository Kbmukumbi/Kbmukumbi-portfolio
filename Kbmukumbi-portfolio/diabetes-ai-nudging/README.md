# 🤖 AI-Powered Predictive Analytics for Remote Diabetes Monitoring

> *By Kudakwashe Mukumbi & Lusubilo Nyondo – Group 9 Project*

## 📌 Objective
This project explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and predictive analytics can enhance diabetes care in **resource-limited rural communities**, providing continuous, personalized feedback and early detection.

## 🌍 Target Populations
- Adults with Type 2 Diabetes in underserved regions
- Elderly patients with mobility or access challenges
- Providers managing wide populations remotely

## 💡 Problem Statement
Traditional diabetes care relies on in-person visits and manual charting, which delay intervention. In rural communities, this leads to poor outcomes and preventable hospitalizations.

## 🧠 Our Solution
Integrate **AI algorithms** with **remote health monitoring tools** like:
- Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs)
- Wearables (heart rate, step count)
- Mobile health (mHealth) apps

To deliver:
- Early warnings for hyper/hypoglycemia
- Nudges (reminders + tips) to encourage behavior change
- Real-time provider dashboards

| Area                          | Description                                       |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Challenges**                | Data reliability, tech access, patient privacy    |
| **Current Tools**             | CGMs, AI chatbots, decision trees, mobile apps    |
| **Gaps**                      | Limited AI integration in low-income settings     |
| **Opportunities**            | SMS-based nudging, low-bandwidth dashboards       |

## 📂 Included Materials
- `blessing_and_lusubilo_group9.pptx` – presentation slides
- `ai-diabetes-report.pdf` – research summary (if created)
- `infographic.png` – AI nudging loop for rural diabetes care

## 👩🏽‍💻 Contributions (Kudakwashe Mukumbi)
- Investigated AI nudging frameworks & rural application
- Created slides and visuals for presentation
- Proposed real-world case examples & policy implications

## 🚀 Future Potential
- Build actual prototype chatbot
