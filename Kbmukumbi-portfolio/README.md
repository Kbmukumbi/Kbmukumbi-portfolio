# 🧪 CANRISK-Based Diabetes Risk Screening in Community Pharmacies

## 🎯 Project Objective
This project evaluates the feasibility and impact of **non-invasive diabetes risk screening** in Zimbabwe using the **CANRISK questionnaire**, implemented in a **community pharmacy setting**.

## 🧠 Background
Diabetes is increasingly common across sub-Saharan Africa, with many cases going undiagnosed. Traditional blood-based screening methods are costly and often inaccessible. CANRISK provides a **low-cost, questionnaire-based alternative** to estimate a person’s 10-year risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

## 📍 Study Summary
- **Location**: CIMAS Pharmacy, Harare, Zimbabwe
- **Duration**: April 15 – 30, 2022
- **Sample**: 100 randomly selected adult participants
- **Tool Used**: Canadian Diabetes Risk Score (CANRISK)

## 🔍 Key Results
- **36%** of participants were in the **very high risk** category
- **52%** were low to moderate risk, and **12%** were high risk
- Older adults, especially **females with obesity and low education**, had significantly higher risk
- Over **50% of men** had a risk score ratio ≥50%, compared to **21% of women**

## 📊 Risk Associations
| Factor                  | Influence on Risk            |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Age > 65               | Strong correlation with high risk |
| Low education          | Higher risk score observed   |
| Family history         | Less reliable in African context |
| Waist circumference    | Strong predictor of diabetes |

## 🏥 Staff Feedback
- 70% rated CANRISK as **very good**
- Recommended improving **language and layout** for clarity
- Highlighted its usefulness for early diabetes education

## 🚀 Conclusion
CANRISK is an **effective, low-cost screening tool** for community pharmacies. It can be tailored for rural African settings to identify high-risk individuals and prevent diabetes through early lifestyle interventions.
